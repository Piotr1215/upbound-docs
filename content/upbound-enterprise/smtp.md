In order to enable user registration, you will need to configure a secret that 
describes your SMTP settings within your environment.

Below is an example secret:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
type: Opaque
metadata:
  name: api-smtp-conn
  namespace: upbound-enterprise
stringData:
  server: "mail.example.com"
  port: "25"
  user: "user@mail.example.com"
  pass: "pass"
  from: "test@mail.example.com"
```

The notable items are:
