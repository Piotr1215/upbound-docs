`up` interacts with a variety of systems, each of which may have information
that should be persisted between commands. `up` stores this information in a
configuration file in `~/.up/config.json`.

## Upbound Configuration

Currently, only configuration information for interacting with Upbound is
stored. The sections below detail the format and how to interact with it. In the
future, additional configuration may be supported for managing UXP and package
installations.

### Format

`up` allows users to define profiles that contain sets of preferences and
credentials for interacting with Upbound. This enables easily executing commands
as different users, or in different accounts. In the example below, five
profiles are defined: `default`, `dev`, `staging`, `prod`, and `ci`. Commands
will use the specified profile when set via the `--profile` flag or `UP_PROFILE`
environment variable. If a profile is not set, `up` will use the profile
specified as `default`, which in this case is actually named `default`.

```json
{
  "upbound": {
    "default": "default",
    "profiles": {
      "default": {
        "id": "hasheddan",
        "type": "user",
        "session": "abcdefg123456789",
        "account": "hasheddan"
      },
      "dev": {
        "id": "hasheddan",
        "type": "user",
        "session": "abcdefg123456789",
        "account": "dev"
      },
      "staging": {
        "id": "hasheddan",
        "type": "user",
        "session": "abcdefg123456789",
        "account": "staging"
      },
      "prod": {
        "id": "hasheddan",
        "type": "user",
        "session": "abcdefg123456789",
        "account": "prod"
      },
      "ci": {
        "id": "faa2d557-9d10-4986-8379-4ad618360e57",
        "type": "token",
        "session": "abcdefg123456789",
        "account": "my-org"
      },
}
```

### Specifying Upbound Instance

Because Upbound offers both a hosted and self-hosted product, users may be
logging in and interacting with [Upbound Cloud] or their own [Upbound
Enterprise] installation. `up` assumes by default that a user is interacting
with Upbound Cloud and will use `https://api.upbound.io` as the endpoint.
However, all commands that interact with Upbound also accept an `--endpoint` /
`UP_ENDPOINT`, which overrides the API endpoint.

### Adding or Updating Profile

To add or update a profile, users can execute `up login` with the appropriate
credentials and a profile name specified. For instance, the following command
would add a new profile named `test`:

```shell
up login --profile test -u hasheddan -p cool-password
```

If no `--profile` is specified, the profile named `default` will be added or
updated with the relevant credentials. If `-a` (`--account`) is specified it
will be set as the default account for the profile, and if it is not specified
and the credential type is `user`, the username will be used as the account as
well as the ID.

### Setting the Default Profile

The profile specified as the value to the `default:` key will be used for
commands when `--profile` / `UP_PROFILE` is not set. Any profile can be used as
the default, but the time a user logs in with the CLI, or if the config file is
empty when a user logs in, the name of the profile used for the login operation
will be set as the `default:`. Note that the profile named `default` is not
necessarily the one that will be specified as `default:`.

In the future, dedicated commands will be introduced to manage profiles and
other configuration data.

### Invalidating Session Tokens

`up` uses session tokens for authentication after login. Tokens are valid for 30
days by default, meaning that a user must login at least once in any 30 day
period. Tokens are sensitive and should not be exposed in any setting. However,
if a token is exposed, assuming it is still present for the given profile in the
configuration file, it can be revoked by running `up logout --profile
<profile-name>`. If a token is exposed and it is no longer present in the
profile and cannot be retrieved for any reason, the user account should reset
its password on [Upbound Cloud] immediately. This can be accomplished today by
clicking "Forgot Password?" on the [Upbound Cloud login page], following the
link in the email you receive, and making sure to check "Delete all active
sessions".
