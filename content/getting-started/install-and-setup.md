First-time Upbound users have two options available to them today. The first is
Upbound Cloud, our "batteries-included" hosted Crossplane service. The other is
Upbound Enterprise, which allows users to install and run Upbound on their own
Kubernetes cluster.

# Start with Upbound Cloud

There is no setup required to get started with Upbound Cloud! You can move on to
[create your account].

# Start with Upbound Enterprise

Installing Upbound into an existing Kubernetes cluster will require a bit more
effort, but can provide more flexibility for users who need it. See [installing enterprise]
for steps on how to proceed with this product.
