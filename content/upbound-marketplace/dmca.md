We take the intellectual property rights of others seriously and require that our Users do the same. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) established a process for addressing claims of copyright infringement. If you own a copyright or have authority to act on behalf of a copyright owner and want to report a claim that a third party is infringing that material on or through Upbound's services, please send a notice that meets the minimum requirements of the DMCA, to dmca@upbound.io, and we will take appropriate action.

## DMCA notice requirements
