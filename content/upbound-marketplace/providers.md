Upbound creates, maintains, and fully supports a set of Crossplane providers called *official providers*. Only [Universal Crossplane (`UXP`)]({{<ref "uxp/" >}}) supports official providers.   

{{<hint type="caution">}}
Official providers aren't supported with open source Crossplane.
{{< /hint >}}

## Find official providers
Identify official providers in the marketplace with the `by Upbound` gold seal.
{{< figure src="/images/marketplace/provider-by-upbound.png" alt="example official provider with a by Upbound seal" >}}

Also find official providers by filtering a [search in the marketplace](https://marketplace.upbound.io/providers?tier=official) to just `Official`.

{{< figure src="/images/marketplace/official-provider-search-filter.png" alt="a marketplace search filter with Providers and Official filters set" >}}
## Required software versions

### Up command-line
Official providers require [Up command-line]({{<ref "cli/" >}}) version v0.13.0 or later.  

Confirm the version of Up command-line with `up --version`

```command
$ up --version
v0.13.0
```

### Universal Crossplane
UXP supports official providers on the following [releases](https://github.com/upbound/up/releases) or later:
* v1.8.1-up.2
* v1.7.2-up.2
* v1.6.7-up.2

Inspect the `crossplane` deployment to confirm the version of Universal Crossplane.

```shell
$ kubectl get deployment crossplane -n upbound-system -o 'jsonpath={@.spec.template.spec.containers.*.image}{"\n"}'
upbound/crossplane:v1.8.1-up.2
```

## Install an official provider
The [Upbound Marketplace](https://marketplace.upbound.io/) hosts official providers. Official providers are only available to registered Upbound users. Official providers require a _robot token_ to authenticate to the Upbound Marketplace and install.

{{< hint type="tip" >}}
If you already installed an official provider using an `imagePullSecret` a new secret isn't required.
{{< /hint >}}

{{< tabs "secrets" >}}
{{< tab "Creating a secret with the Up command-line" >}}
## Log in with the Up command-line
Use `up login` to authenticate to the Upbound Marketplace.

It's important to use `-a <your organization>` when logging in. Only accounts belonging to organizations can use official providers.

```shell
$ up login -a my-org
username: my-user
password: 
my-user logged in
```

## Create an Upbound robot account
Upbound robots are identities used for authentication that are independent from a single user and arenâ€™t tied to specific usernames or passwords.

Creating a robot account allows Kubernetes to install an official provider.

Use `up robot create <robot account name>` to create a new robot account.

_Note_: only users logged into an organization can create robot accounts.

```shell
$ up robot create my-robot
my-org/my-robot created
```

## Create an Upbound robot account token
The token associates with a specific robot account and acts as a username and password for authentication.

Generate a token using `up robot token create <robot account> <token name> --output=<file>`.

```shell
$ up robot token create my-robot my-token --output=token.json
my-org/my-robot/my-token created
```

The `output` file is a JSON file containing the robot token's `accessId` and `token`. The `accessId` is the username and `token` is the password for the token.

_Note_: you can't recover a lost robot token. You must delete and recreate the token.


## Create a Kubernetes pull secret
Downloading and installing official providers requires Kubernetes to authenticate to the Upbound Marketplace using a Kubernetes `secret` object.

Using the `up controlplane pull-secret create <secret name> -f <robot token file>` command create an [Upbound robot account](http://docs.upbound.io/cli/command-reference/robot/) account. 

Provide a name for your Kubernetes secret and the robot token JSON file.

_Note_: robot accounts are independent from your account. Your account information is never stored in Kubernetes.

_Note_: you must provide the robot token file or you can't authenticate to install an official provider.  

```shell
$ up controlplane pull-secret create my-upbound-secret -f token.json
my-org/my-upbound-secret created
```

`Up` creates the secret in the `upbound-system` namespace. 

```shell
$ kubectl get secret -n upbound-system
NAME                                         TYPE                             DATA   AGE
my-upbound-secret                            kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson   1      8m46s
sh.helm.release.v1.universal-crossplane.v1   helm.sh/release.v1               1      21m
upbound-agent-tls                            Opaque                           3      21m
uxp-ca                                       Opaque                           3      21m
xgql-tls                                     Opaque                           3      21m
```

### Create a Kubernetes imagePullSecret
Official providers require a Kubernetes `imagePullSecret` to download and install. 

<!-- TODO:
The credentials for the `imagePullSecret` are from an authorized Upbound robot token. Find details on creating robot tokens in the [robot accounts documentation] -->

Create an `imagePull` Secret with `kubectl create secret docker-registry` command with the following options:
* `--namespace` the same namespace as Upbound. By default this is `upbound-system`.
* `--docker-server` as `xpkg.upbound.io`
* `--docker-username` the _Access ID_ value of the robot token
* `--docker-password` the _Token_ value of the robot token

For example, create an imagePullSecret with the name `my-upbound-secret`
```shell
kubectl create secret docker-registry my-upbound-secret \
--namespace=upbound-system \
--docker-server=xpkg.upbound.io \
--docker-username=42bde5f3-81c1-4243-ab53-e301c71acc90 \
--docker-password=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJqdGkiOiI0MmJkZTVmMy04MWMxLTQyNDMtYWI1My1lMzAxYzcxYWNjOTAiLCJzdWIiOiJyb2JvdHxhYWQ0MTk4NC0wOWFmLTQxYWEtYjcxYi0zZGZlNjI0MDI2YTUifQ.bqcW3UZGIFL2yU0rkKbLRhU_TfK4HCi4ckgjtHVT4rLGip5I0lFXTcr7VLdCnNO2c2q_nU7Bf7r05G_ZPBT3yZB85UQhzp7COFHjH5YIQbQFqT3354YS4DMHV_tLp0dtLj-3ojbUbVDtHV2RScqUPaD2s--S6m9Jz7xLuCRnqqYKFeSyyo_4aNrH4AVp--ER8VVzF3tc0WkAgkZ9aGEsbhnDHjECNp0krPMop1Nl6RvJ5KUSGPKZe_yptZMD82JtxcULjPo1sWd8i4G4jd8m567rGW1MzutUtfETNFpjd8BWAwLakZwEyIkfb6B8u6OvgOd0RK-cMCfCPoKvVRxHFQ
```

Verify the secret with `kubectl get secrets`
```shell
$ kubectl get secrets -n upbound-system my-upbound-secret
NAME                  TYPE                             DATA   AGE
my-upbound-secret   kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson   1      23s
```

### Install the provider resource
Install a provider by creating a `Provider` Kubernetes resource. Provide the `spec.package` location of the official provider. Provide `spec.packagePullSecrets.name` of the imagePullSecret to use.

For example, install the AWS provider with the following Kubernetes configuration file.

```yaml
apiVersion: pkg.crossplane.io/v1
kind: Provider
metadata:
    name: provider-aws
spec:
  package: xpkg.upbound.io/upbound/provider-aws:v0.5.0
  packagePullSecrets:
    - name: my-upbound-secret
```

Find provider specific instructions and configurations in their individual documentation pages.

## Versions and releases
Official providers have two relevant release numbers:
* Provider release, for example, `provider-aws:v0.5.0`
* Custom Resource Definition (*CRD*) API version, for example `v1beta1`

### Provider releases
Upbound releases new providers to provide bug fixes and enhancements. Provider versions follow standard semantic versioning (*semver*) standards of `<major>`.`<minor>`.`<patch>` numbering.

**Major version** changes have significant changes to provider behavior or breaking changes to general availability CRD APIs.  

**Minor version** changes expand provider capabilities or create breaking changes to `alpha` or `beta` CRD APIs. Minor versions never change general availability CRD APIs.

**Patch version** changes are bug fixes. Provider capabilities and CRD APIs aren't changed between patch versions. 


### Custom resource definition API versions
The CRDs contained within an official provider follow the standard Kubernetes API versioning and deprecation policy. 

* `v1alpha` - CRDs under `v1alpha` haven't passed through full Upbound quality assurance. `v1alpha1` providers are for testing and experimentation and aren't intended for production deployment.

* `v1beta1` - This identifies a qualified and tested CRD. 
Upbound attempts to ensure a stable CRD API but may require breaking changes in future versions. `v1beta1` may be missing endpoints or settings related to the provider resource.

* `v1beta2` - Like `v1beta1` CRDs all `v1beta2` providers are fully qualified and tested. `v1beta2` contain more features or breaking API changes from `v1beta1`. 

* `v1` - CRDs that reach a `v1` API version have fully defined APIs. Upbound doesn't make breaking API changes until the next provider API version. 

## Support
Official providers are available to all paid Upbound customers. Support for official providers follows the same support model for other Upbound components. 

More information is available on the [support page]({{<ref "../support.md" >}}).
